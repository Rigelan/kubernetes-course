# UDEMY
I typically have about 15-30 Udemy courses that I actively am interested in and since start of 2021 have been averaging 4 to 5 Udemy course completions ever 4 to 5 weeks.

This course was on my on b-list (something to complete next quarter Q2/2021) but started looking at resources.

In Q4/Q1 I completed 2 ansible courses, 2 business analysis courses, 1 wordpress security course on Udemy plus a half dozen other ones.


## Progress

Learn DevOps: The Complete Kubernetes Course

1. Reviewed course on android phone after subscribing; set to download all episodes
2. Reviewed resource.  Very much appreciated Github respository for course being available to students
3. Reviewed resource.  Extremely happy to have the Course slides available as a PDF.  Sorry but I will not be uploading to repo as I don't believe 
~ interim rating:  for resources, this course is a 5-of-5.  All materials can be reviewed as needed, on demand, and not lost in online notebook formats.
I appreciate the extra effort - 5 of 5
4. Quick review of courses.
  ~ still need to view more than 20 percent
  ~ from outline, over 80 percent of the course never gets into the DevOps side that drives the applications that make use of Kubernetes.
    from outline, it seems over 60+ percent is kubernetes infrastructure rather than a "DevOps" course that shouldn't have more than 20% rehashing kubernetes.
5.  Still optimistic the overview of tasks will address
